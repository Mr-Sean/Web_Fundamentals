This Web Fundamentals repo reflects my HTML and CSS assignments completed during 
my time enrolled in the Coding Dojo Bootcamp and acts as an "Intro-to-Programming"
that students take right before beginging one of the available "Programming Stacks" 
of courses. I took and completed their "Full-Stack" course curriculum which includes 
(Python, Java & React <aka MERN>).

The name of this repo (& most of its folders) and its general folder structure was 
determined by the course.
